Libraries needed:
    numpy
    math
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    os
    scipy
    PIL

I made another file called tree.py that holds the Node and DecisionTree classes. They are responsible for the parts to make the tree.

To run the program:
    The listed libraries need to be installed, the yalefaces directory and CTG.csv data need to be at the same level as hw4.py and tree.py.

    To run the program: python3 ./hw4.py

    Within the "if ___name__ == "__main__"", you can comment or uncomment depending on which classification algorithm you want to run.

    For KNN: 
        For preprocessing, I z-scored the features.

        You can change the data path via the global variable that is passed through on line 85. The options are CTG_DATA_PATH and YALEFACES_PATH. To change the k value, you have to change the last paramter passed through to myKNN on line 86.

        On completion the code prints the accuracy and produces a confusion matrix.

    For DT:
        I wasnt able to complete DT. I tried implementing as much as possible.
